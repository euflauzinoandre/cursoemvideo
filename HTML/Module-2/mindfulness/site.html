		<p>Mindfulness is the practice of paying attention to the present moment, without judgment, and with an attitude of openness and curiosity. It involves being aware of your thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations as they arise, without getting carried away by them or trying to change them. </p>
		<h2>Present Moment Awareness:</h2>
		<p>Mindfulness focuses on the here and now, rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. </p>
		<h2>Non-Judgmental Observation:</h2>
		<p>It encourages observing your experiences without labeling them as good or bad, right or wrong. </p>
		<h2>Acceptance:</h2>
		<p>Mindfulness involves accepting your thoughts and feelings as they are, without trying to suppress or control them. </p>
		<h2>Active Engagement:</h2>
		<p>It's an active process of paying attention, rather than a passive state of mind. </p>
		<h2>Formal and Informal Practice:</h2>
		<p>Mindfulness can be cultivated through formal meditation practices, but it can also be integrated into everyday activities like walking, eating, or even washing dishes.</p>
		<p>Mindfulness is not about emptying your mind or achieving a state of bliss. It's about developing the ability to observe your inner world with greater clarity and to respond to situations with more awareness and less reactivity. </p>
